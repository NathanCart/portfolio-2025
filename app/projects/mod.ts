	technologies: ['react-logo.svg', 'mui-logo.svg', 'nodejs-logo.svg', 'express-logo.svg'],
	how: 'By utilising React, Material-UI, Node.js, and Express.js, we were able to build a website that met the client requirements. React was used to build the frontend of the website, Material-UI was used for the styling of the website, and Node.js and Express.js were used to build the backend of the website. The website has role management to allow different users to access different parts of the website. For example, detainees can access information and staff can manage resources. There are files, news, user management, action history for admins to view detainee activity, useful links and a dynamic form creation system which creates dynamic forms for detainees to fill out. Staff can view and download this data from the dashboard.',
	conclusion:
		'Military Corrective Training Centre was successfully created to a high standard and met the client requirements. The website is engaging and provides a seamless user experience. The website is built using React, Material-UI, Node.js, and Express.js. I successfully deepened my understanding on role management systems and created a dynamic form creation system which creates forms for detainees to fill out. Staff can view and download this data from the dashboard.',
